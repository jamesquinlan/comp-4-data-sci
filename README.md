# Computational Techniques for Data Science

This course provides a practical introduction to the data science workflow using Python. Successful completion of the course will involve using advanced features of Python, retrieving information in data files, working with numpy and pandas library, visualizing information and completing an end to end data science project.

## Data Science Process

One common data science project lifecycle is the OSEMN:

1. Obtain
2. Scrub
3. Explore
4. Model
5. Interpret


## End-to-End Machine Learning Process

Although there is no prescriptive process, here are the main steps you go through \cite{geron2022hands}:

1. Look at the big picture.
2. Get the data.
3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights.
4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms.
5. Select a model and train it.
6. Fine-tune your model.
7. Present your solution.
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.
